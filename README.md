# Thirdweb Examples

## Structure

- Example implementations are scoped by language
- Each example project within one of the top-level language folders should be individually clone-able
- Each example project has to include a `README.md` in its root which needs to contain:
  - name of the example
  - description of the example
  - which technologies it uses _outside of_ the thirdweb sdk
  - what thirdweb sdk methods are utilized in the example
  - how to run the example project locally after cloning
